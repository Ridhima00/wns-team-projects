# Invoice Translation System

## Project Code and Explanation

The code below is designed to translate multilingual invoices into English using the `googletrans` library. This is a simple yet powerful tool for translation, ideal for processing invoices from different regions.

### Importing the Required Package

First, let's install and import the necessary packages.

```python
# Import the Translator class from googletrans library
from googletrans import Translator
```

- **`googletrans`**: This is a Python library that provides an easy way to use Google Translate. 
  - It allows us to translate text from one language to another.
  - `googletrans` works as a wrapper around the Google Translate API, which makes it very effective for language translation.

### Define the Translation Function

```python
# Define a function named translate_invoice that will handle the translation
def translate_invoice(text, target_language='en'):
    # Create a Translator object to use for translation
    translator = Translator()
    # Translate the text to the target language and store the result
    translation = translator.translate(text, dest=target_language)
    # Return the translated text
    return translation.text
```

- **`def translate_invoice(text, target_language='en'):`**  
  - This function takes two parameters: 
    - `text`: The text to be translated (in this case, invoice content).
    - `target_language`: The language to translate to, set to `'en'` for English by default.
    
- **`translator = Translator()`**  
  - Here, we create an instance of the `Translator` class.
  - This object allows us to access translation methods and translate text into different languages.
  
- **`translation = translator.translate(text, dest=target_language)`**  
  - `translate()` is a method provided by `googletrans` to perform the translation.
  - `text` is the content we want to translate, and `dest=target_language` specifies the target language.
  - The result is stored in the variable `translation`, which contains both the translated text and additional metadata like the original language detected.

- **`return translation.text`**  
  - This line returns only the translated text from the `translation` object.

### Example Usage of the Function

```python
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample text in Spanish to demonstrate the function
    invoice_text = "Factura No. 12345, Fecha: 01/08/2024, Importe Total: 1500 EUR"
    
    # Call the translate_invoice function with the sample text
    translated_text = translate_invoice(invoice_text)
    
    # Print the original text and the translated result
    print("Original Invoice Text:", invoice_text)
    print("Translated Invoice Text:", translated_text)
```

- **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**  
  - This line ensures that the code inside this block will only run if the script is executed directly.
  - This is useful to prevent code from running if the script is imported as a module in another program.

- **`invoice_text = "Factura No. 12345, Fecha: 01/08/2024, Importe Total: 1500 EUR"`**  
  - This is an example text representing an invoice in Spanish.
  - You can replace this with any other text to translate invoices in different languages.

- **`translated_text = translate_invoice(invoice_text)`**  
  - This line calls the `translate_invoice` function, passing in `invoice_text`.
  - The function returns the translated text, which is stored in `translated_text`.

- **`print("Original Invoice Text:", invoice_text)`**  
  - This line prints the original text, allowing users to see the input before translation.

- **`print("Translated Invoice Text:", translated_text)`**  
  - This line prints the translated text so users can see the result in English.

## How the Code Works

1. **Imports**: We start by importing the `googletrans` library.
2. **Translation Function**: The `translate_invoice()` function is defined to take in invoice text and translate it to English or any specified language.
3. **Function Usage**: In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, we provide sample invoice text in Spanish and call the function to translate it.
4. **Output**: The original and translated texts are printed, helping users understand the input-output process.

## Important Notes

- **Accuracy**: The translation relies on Google Translate, which provides accurate translations for most major languages.
- **Target Language**: You can change the target language by modifying the `target_language` parameter in `translate_invoice`.
- **Customization**: To translate other fields in invoices (e.g., numerical data), you might integrate this function into a larger data processing pipeline.

This code is simple yet functional, perfect for a first version of an invoice translation system. Feel free to adjust the text in `invoice_text` or expand the function to handle larger data inputs as needed.
